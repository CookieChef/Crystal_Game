# Crystal Game! 

To win the game the user must reach a goal number that is randomized at the beginning of the game by clicking on gems that also have a random value assigned to them. 

If the user wins or losses it will prompt an alert that will then refresh the page allowing the user to continue playing with a new goal and new gem values. 

    * This game uses basic javascript to assing random values using the Math.floor to both the goal and each of the gems. 

    * It then uses the .onClick function to execute the game functions. It will update the current value (the sum of the onClicks for each of the gem values), and display it on the html.

    * The game then uses conditional values to see if the user reached the goal of it the user exceeds the goal value. 

User can look at the console log to see the values of each gem.
